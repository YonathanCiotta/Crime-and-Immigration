# Immigration, Crime, and GDP Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between immigration rates, crime growth, and GDP growth in selected European countries (Italy, Germany, and France). Using data from various public sources, the study aims to understand if and how immigration impacts crime rates and economic growth, providing valuable insights for policymakers and researchers.

## Objectives
- Analyze immigration, crime, and GDP data from Italy, Germany, and France.
- Explore potential correlations between immigration rates and crime growth.
- Assess the relationship between immigration rates and GDP growth.
- Draw conclusions to inform policy recommendations and highlight areas for future research.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project was gathered from official statistics on crime, immigration, and GDP. Specific data sources include:
- Eurostat (crime and immigration statistics)
- World Bank (GDP data)

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Imported and cleaned data on immigration rates, crime statistics, and GDP growth for each country.
2. **Data Preparation**: Aligned datasets by year and country, handled missing values, and calculated growth rates.
3. **Normalization**: Adjusted data where necessary to ensure comparability across countries.
4. **Data Integration**: Merged crime, immigration, and GDP data into a single dataset for analysis.
5. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - Visualized trends for each country.
   - Calculated and visualized year-over-year growth rates.
   - Analyzed correlations between variables.

## Key Findings
- **Immigration and Crime**: Observed that increases in immigration rates did not correspond to proportional increases in crime rates, suggesting other factors likely play a role.
- **Immigration and GDP**: Found a positive correlation between immigration and GDP growth, indicating that immigration may support economic growth.
- **GDP and Crime**: Analysis suggested no clear correlation between GDP growth and crime rates, underscoring the complexity of socio-economic impacts.

## Visualizations
The following key visualizations were created to support our findings:
1. **Crime Growth vs. Immigration Growth**: Illustrates the relationship between immigration rates and crime growth.
2. **Immigration Rate vs. GDP Growth**: Shows the positive correlation between immigration and GDP.
3. **GDP Growth vs. Crime Growth**: Highlights the lack of a clear relationship between economic growth and crime rates.

## Conclusion
This analysis concludes that immigration does not appear to drive crime growth in the studied countries and may contribute positively to GDP growth. However, the relationship between GDP and crime remains complex, likely influenced by multiple socio-economic factors.

## Future Research
- Expanding the dataset to include more countries and years.
- Investigating other factors, such as employment and income inequality, that may mediate the relationship between immigration, crime, and GDP.
- Using machine learning to model more complex relationships and predictive insights.
